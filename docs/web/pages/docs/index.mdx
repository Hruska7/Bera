# Welcome to Polaris VM

Polaris VM introduces the new standard of EVM on Cosmos. With improvements to speed, security, reliability,
and an extended set of features, Polaris VM will be able to support the next generation of
Cosmos applications while offering a compelling alternative to existing implementations.

Polaris VM is a blockchain framework built on top of the Cosmos SDK that offers a full-featured EVM with full
interoperability to the Cosmos ecosystem. It achieves this through the use of various [Stateful Precompiles]() built
into the chain that act as gateways to the greater Cosmos framework. This allows EVM users to perform Cosmos native operations such as voting on governance,
delegating to validators, and even communicating with other chains through IBC. This design allows us to maintain
the native EVM user experience without sacrifices, providing true interoperability between the Cosmos ecosystem and EVM.

Apart from Polaris VM's focus on interoperability, it also offers a number of other improvements over existing
EVM implementation such as :

- Improved performance when executing common transactions
- Enhanced Mempool implementation
- Optimized storage model
- Reliability improvements for JSON-RPC Providers
  what we offer

Overall, Polaris VM is a powerful new framework for developers and users to enjoy. Its seamless integration with other
Cosmos chains and robust EVM support make it a promising platform for building decentralized applications and unlocks
new use cases for blockchain technology.
