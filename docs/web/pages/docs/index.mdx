# Stargazer

/// comments

Stargazer is a blockchain framework built on top of the Cosmos SDK that offers superior support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compared to Ethermint, another popular EVM implementation.

One of the key features of Stargazer is its ability to seamlessly integrate with other blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem, allowing for the transfer of digital assets and data between different chains. This is made possible through the use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, which is built into the Cosmos SDK and enables secure, trustless communication between different blockchains.

In addition to IBC, Stargazer also supports other Cosmos SDK modules, including those for governance, staking, and account management. This provides users with a rich set of features and tools for managing and improving the network.

However, where Stargazer truly shines is in its superior support for the EVM. Stargazer is designed to be fully compatible with the Ethereum network, meaning that it can support all existing Ethereum dApps and smart contracts without requiring any modifications or additional development work. This is achieved through a high-performance EVM implementation that is optimized for speed and reliability.

Stargazer also offers robust security features, including support for the latest Ethereum network upgrades and improved protection against common attack vectors, such as reentrancy attacks and gas limit vulnerabilities.

Overall, Stargazer is a powerful new framework that offers a compelling alternative to existing EVM implementations like Ethermint. Its seamless integration with other Cosmos chains and robust EVM support make it a promising platform for building decentralized applications and unlocking new use cases for blockchain technology.
