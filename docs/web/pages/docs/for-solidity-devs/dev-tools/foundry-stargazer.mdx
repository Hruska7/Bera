# Using Foundry with Stargazer EVM

## Introduction

This guide shows how to deploy and interact with smart contracts using foundry
on a local Stargazer EVM network.

[Foundry toolchain](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is a smart contract
development toolchain written in Rust. It manages your dependencies, compiles
your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the
command-line.

## Recommended Knowledge

- Basic understanding of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org) and Cosmos.
- Basic understanding of the [Stargazer's architecture]() 
- Basic understanding of [Olympus DAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/)
## Requirements

- You have [installed
  Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) and run `foundryup`. This
  installation includes the `forge` and `cast` binaries used in this
  walk-through.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) version `16.x`
- You have a running instance of Stargazer EVM. See [Starting A Node]()
