# Launching Your Smart Contracts on Stargazer

## Overview

The Purpose of this section is to provide information that will help you launch your smart contracts on Stargazer. 
You will how to use various EVM development tools with Stargazer along with examples. We will show you how to connect to the network, 
how to use your existing projects on Stargazer, as well as any additional information relating to Stargazer's new features.

## Stargazer EVM 
Stargazer's EVM is designed to adhere to the geth interface, which means that any tool that works with [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) can also be used to interact with Stargazer. The EVM is still responsible for executing Solidity smart contracts and managing the chain's data structures and blocks. By using CometBFT's consensus protocol and the Cosmos-SDK, Stargazer is able to access Cosmos-SDK properties through [precompiles](../building-precompiles/intro-to-precompiles), while also remaining compatible with all Ethereum Solidity smart contracts.

It's important to note that Stargazer's EVM is interoperable with its Cosmos-SDK Application Layer. This means that Smart Contract Developers have access to base Cosmos-SDK modules through the EVM. With this new feature, developers can access Cosmos features like on-chain governance, the IBC protocol, and various other Cosmos-SDK modules.

From the perspective of a Smart Contract, it will run in the same way as it would on Ethereum, but with additional contract addresses that provide access to the chain's Cosmos-SDK modules.

## Accessing Stargazer's EVM
