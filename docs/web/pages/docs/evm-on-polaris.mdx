# EVM on Polaris VM

Polaris VM offers an improved EVM experience that goes beyond the basic implementation of Ethereum.
In addition to the reliable and consistent Ethereum functionality, Polaris VM offers developers the 
creation of stateful precompiles & custom modules that developers can use to create more efficient and 
powerful smart contracts.

## Powered By Cosmos & Geth

TODO DEV
Polaris VM is powered by the Cosmos SDK and Go-Ethereum library.

## Additional Features

Polaris VM offers several additional features to enhance the EVM experience, 
including stateful precompiles, custom opcodes, and the ERC20 middleware.

### Stateful Precompiles
Stateful precompiles are precompiled contracts that can alter state on the 
chain, enabling more efficient stateful operations at a lower gas cost. 
The [Precompiles] section provides a more detailed explanation of 
how Polaris VM uses these precompiled contracts.

### Custom Opcodes

Custom opcodes have been added to Polaris VM's EVM implementation to provide additional 
functionality and support for complex smart contracts. However, some of the opcodes 
provided by Ethereum are not compatible with Polaris VM's EVM implementation, 
which may affect contracts that use these opcodes. The [Opcode Documentation] 
provides information on these changes.

### ERC20 Middleware

TODO DEV


The ERC20 middleware provides a standardized interface for managing ERC20 tokens on
the Polaris VM blockchain. This middleware simplifies the process of managing ERC20 tokens, 
making it easier for developers to create decentralized applications that interact with these tokens.
The [ERC20 Middleware] section provides more information on this topic.
