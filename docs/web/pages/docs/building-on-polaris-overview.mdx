# Building On Polaris

Polaris offers developers a robust framework to build on top of, 
allowing builders to create [Custom Modules], [Precompiles], and other 
functionality needed to tailor the blockchain to their specific 
use case. This flexibility enables developers to create custom Cosmos
blockchains that meet the unique needs of their EVM-compatible project, 
without being restricted by the limitations of other outdated frameworks.

## Getting Started

### Frontend Developers
[For Frontend Developers], Polaris provides a dedicated section with resources and guides to help create user-friendly and engaging frontend applications.
### Solidity Developers
[For Solidity developers], Polaris offers a section specifically for building and deploying [Solidity] smart contracts with Polaris.
### Cosmwasm Developers
[For Cosmwasm Developers], a future Polaris upgrade planned for building and deploying [Cosmwasm] smart contracts with Polaris.


### More
In addition to these resources, Polaris also provides information on how to 
customize developers blockchains with custom modules and precompiles, enabling builders 
to build a blockchain that meets their specific needs. The [Custom Modules] 
and [Custom Precompiles] sections provide valuable information and resources 
for developers looking to build on top of Polaris.

Finally, Polaris welcomes contributions from the developer community and 
offers a [Contributing] section with information on how to get involved and 
contribute to the development of Polaris.
