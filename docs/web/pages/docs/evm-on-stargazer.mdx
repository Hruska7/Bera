# EVM on Stargazer

Stargazer, developed by the Berachain Foundation, offers an improved EVM experience 
that goes beyond the basic implementation of Ethereum. In addition to the core 
Ethereum functionality, Stargazer offers a range of extra stateful precompiles 
that enable efficient stateful operations at a much lower gas cost.

These precompiles are designed to enhance the performance and efficiency of the blockchain,
making it easier and more cost-effective for developers to create complex smart contracts 
and decentralized applications. By leveraging these precompiles, developers can create more 
powerful and feature-rich applications without being limited by the gas cost of stateful operations.

These additional features provide developers with powerful 
tools for creating complex smart contracts and decentralized 
applications on the Stargazer blockchain. 
## Powered By Cosmos & Geth

Stargazer is powered by the Cosmos SDK and Go-Ethereum library.

## Additional Features

Stargazer offers several additional features to enhance the EVM experience, 
including stateful precompiles, custom opcodes, and the ERC20 middleware.

### Stateful Precompiles
Stateful precompiles are precompiled contracts that can alter state on the 
chain, enabling more efficient stateful operations at a lower gas cost. 
The [Precompiles] section provides a more detailed explanation of 
how Stargazer uses these precompiled contracts.

### Custom Opcodes

Custom opcodes have been added to Stargazer's EVM implementation to provide additional 
functionality and support for complex smart contracts. However, some of the opcodes 
provided by Ethereum are not compatible with Stargazer's EVM implementation, 
which may affect contracts that use these opcodes. The [Opcode Documentation] 
provides information on these changes.

### ERC20 Middleware

The ERC20 middleware provides a standardized interface for managing ERC20 tokens on
the Stargazer blockchain. This middleware simplifies the process of managing ERC20 tokens, 
making it easier for developers to create decentralized applications that interact with these tokens.
The [ERC20 Middleware] section provides more information on this topic.
