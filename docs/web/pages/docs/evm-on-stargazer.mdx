# EVM on Stargazer

Created by the Berachain Foundation, Stargazer provides an enhanced EVM experience.
Beyond the base implementation of Ethereum, Stargazer provides extra stateful precompiles
that efficiently support stateful operations at a fraction of the gas cost.

## Powered By Cosmos & Geth

Stargazer is powered by the Cosmos SDK and Go-Ethereum library.

## Additional Features

In order to provide an enhanced EVM experience, Stargazer provides some Additional
features to the EVM through the use of Cosmos SDK modules, custom Opcodes, and Stateful precompiles.

### Stateful Precompiles

Stateful precompiles are precompiled contracts that are able to store state on the chain. For a more in depth 
overview of how Stargazer uses precompiled contracts please view the [Precompile Overview](./precompile-overview) section.

### Custom Opcodes

Some of the Opcodes provided by Ethereum are not compatible with Stargazer's EVM implementation.
This will not impact EVM contracts that use these Opcodes. It is important to note these changes
which can be found in the [Opcode Documentation](./opcodes).

### ERC20 Middleware

wtf is this lol
