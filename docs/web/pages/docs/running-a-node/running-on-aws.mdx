The recommended way to run fault tolerant nodes that can scale to millions of requests per second would be
with orchestration tool like Kubernetes. Another option is to run the node on an EC2 instance. 

AWS offers [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) which is a manged service to run Kubernetes in the cloud
It allows us to run lightweight pods, inside which you can deploy container images. On a failure, a new container automatically comes up. Each pod 
can also be attached to a volume that can provide elastic disk storage. It also allows us to scale horizontally by adding more nodes/pods/containers on demand to the network. 

### Recommended AWS architecture
Currently, the application runs in 1 container so we can deploy 1 container in each pod. Pod is the smallest resource that 
Kubernetes can manage. It can have 1 or more than 1 containers.
