## Installation of a Cosmos-SDK Blockchain

### From docker container artifactory

The easiest way to run the node in a docker container is to use a pre-built container image. You can find the images in the [container regsitry](Coming Soon)

### From container image 

1. Install Docker on your machine from the [official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

    Verify it's installed

    ```sh 
    docker version
    ```

    If not installed, verify that the path is set correctly and docker daemon is running in background

2. Pull the docker image
    
    You can point to the release image. Referring to `latest` in this case 

    ```sh 
    docker image pull <stargazer-container-registry>/stargazer:latest>
    ```

    Note: Might have to use different docker image for different OS

3. Run the container image

    ```sh
    docker run -p 1317:1317 <stargazer-container-registry>/stargazer:latest>
    ```


Now you have a node running on your machine with a default chain and we have RPC running on port `1317` and path `eth/rpc`. To test, 
you can run ```curl -X POST -d {""}``` 

A successful JSON RPC query will return in following -
