# Building On Stargazer

TODO SAMI

Stargazer offers developers a robust framework to build on top of, 
allowing builders to create [Custom Modules], [Precompiles], and other 
functionality needed to tailor the blockchain to their specific 
use case. This flexibility enables developers to create custom Cosmos
blockchains that meet the unique needs of their EVM-compatible project, 
without being restricted by the limitations of other outdated frameworks.

With Stargazer, developers can leverage the power of Cosmos SDK, 
which provides a modular and scalable platform for building custom 
blockchains. This, coupled with the ability to create custom 
functionality, makes Stargazer a powerful tool for building 
innovative and unique blockchain applications.

## Getting Started

### Frontend Developers
[For Frontend Developers], Stargazer provides a dedicated section with resources and guides to help create user-friendly and engaging frontend applications.
### Solidity Developers
[For Solidity developers], Stargazer offers a section specifically for building and deploying [Solidity] smart contracts with Stargazer.
### Cosmwasm Developers
[For Cosmwasm Developers], a future Stargazer upgrade planned for building and deploying [Cosmwasm] smart contracts with Stargazer.


### More
In addition to these resources, Stargazer also provides information on how to 
customize developers blockchains with custom modules and precompiles, enabling builders 
to build a blockchain that meets their specific needs. The [Custom Modules] 
and [Custom Precompiles] sections provide valuable information and resources 
for developers looking to build on top of Stargazer.

Finally, Stargazer welcomes contributions from the developer community and 
offers a [Contributing] section with information on how to get involved and 
contribute to the development of Stargazer.
