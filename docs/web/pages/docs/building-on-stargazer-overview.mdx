# Building On Stargazer

Stargazer offers a robust framework for developers to build on, 
allowing them to create [Custom Modules], [Precompiles], and other 
functionality needed to tailor the blockchain to their specific 
use case. This flexibility enables developers to create custom 
blockchains that meet the unique needs of their project, without 
being restricted by the limitations of a pre-built blockchain.

With Stargazer, developers can leverage the power of Cosmos SDK, 
which provides a modular and scalable platform for building custom 
blockchains. This, coupled with the ability to create custom 
functionality, makes Stargazer a powerful tool for building 
innovative and unique blockchain applications.

## Getting Started

### Frontend Developers
[For Frontend Developers], Stargazer provides a dedicated section with resources and guides to help create user-friendly and engaging frontend applications.
### Solidity Developers
[For Solidity developers], Stargazer offers a section specifically for building and deploying [Solidity] smart contracts on the Stargazer blockchain.
### Cosmwasm Developers
[For Cosmwasm Developers], Stargazer has a section dedicated to building and deploying [Cosmwasm] smart contracts on the Stargazer blockchain.


### More
In addition to these resources, Stargazer also provides information on how to 
customize the blockchain with custom modules and precompiles, enabling developers 
to build a blockchain that meets their specific needs. The [Custom Modules] 
and [Custom Precompiles] sections provide valuable information and resources 
for developers looking to build on top of Stargazer.

Finally, Stargazer welcomes contributions from the developer community and 
offers a [Contributing] section with information on how to get involved and 
contribute to the development of the Stargazer blockchain.
