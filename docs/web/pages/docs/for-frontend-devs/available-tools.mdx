# Available Tools

Through the use of precompiled contracts, dApps built on stargazer can interact
with cosmos modules as if they are interacting with a smart contract on main net.
There is no cosmos-specific behavior to consider for the end developer.

There are a number of available tools for dApp developers building on Stargazer. Being an
EVM compatible chain, it's tool set is interoperable with the broader EVM ecosystem.
Here are a few of the tools available for Stargazer:

### Wagmi.sh

### Web3React

### Ethers.js
