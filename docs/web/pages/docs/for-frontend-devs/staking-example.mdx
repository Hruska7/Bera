# Building a Staking dApp
We will create a straightforward staking decentralized application (dApp) 
in this section, which will be linked to a [Local Node](). This dApp will 
use the [staking precompile]() feature to obtain information about validators 
and delegators from the EVM, as well as to create delegate transactions 
on the EVM natively.

For this example, we will use wagmi.sh, next.js, rainbowkit, and chakra-ui
to develop a staking dApp that has a basic design.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v12.0.0 or higher
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) v1.22.0 or higher
- Basic knowledge of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Basic knowledge of [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- Basic knowlege of [wagmi.sh](https://wagmi.sh)
- Basic knowledge of [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- Basic knowledge of [Rainbow Kit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)

## Setup Wagmi Project

Run the following command to create a folder
that contains a sample wagmi / rainbowkit / next dApp

Run the following command:

`yarn create wagmi`

After running the above command, input the following values: 
```sh

✔ What is your project named? … staking-precompile-example
✔ What framework would you like to use? › Next.js
✔ What template would you like to use? › RainbowKit
```

This command will create a folder named `staking-precompile-example`. Inside this folder 
there will be a Next.js project with RainbowKit and Wagmi installed and configured.

the folder called `staking-precompile-example` will look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="staking-precompile-example" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="node_modules" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" >
        <FileTree.Folder name="components">
            <FileTree.File name="Account.tsx" />
            <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="pages">
            <FileTree.File name="_app.tsx" />
            <FileTree.File name="index.tsx" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="wagmi.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name=".env.example" />
    <FileTree.File name=".eslintrc.jsom" />
    <FileTree.File name=".gitignore" />
    <FileTree.File name=".npmrc" />
    <FileTree.File name="next-env.d.ts" />
    <FileTree.File name="package-lock.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
    <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Configuring `wagmi.ts`

In order to point this dapp towards a Stargazer local node, 
we need to modify `wagmi.ts`.
