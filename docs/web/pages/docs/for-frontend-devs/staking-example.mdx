# Building a Staking dApp
We will create a straightforward staking decentralized application (dApp) 
in this section, which will be linked to a [Local Node](). This dApp will 
use the [staking precompile]() feature to obtain information about validators 
and delegators from the EVM, as well as to create delegate transactions 
on the EVM natively.

For this example, we will use wagmi.sh, next.js, rainbowkit, and chakra-ui
to develop a staking dApp that has a basic design.
