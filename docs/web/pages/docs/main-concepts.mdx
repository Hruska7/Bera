# Main Concepts


A compiled list of core concepts relevant to Stargazer
as well as the broader EVM and Cosmos-SDK ecosystems

## Cosmos-SDK
The Cosmos SDK is a modular framework that allows developers 
to easily build and customize their own blockchain applications. 
It provides a set of tools and modules that can be used to create
a new blockchain, or to add new features to an existing blockchain

One of the key benefits of the Cosmos SDK is its interoperability with
other blockchains. It allows developers to create "zones" that are connected
to a central "hub" blockchain, enabling cross-chain communication and interoperability.
This makes it possible to create decentralized applications that can interact with
multiple blockchains at the same time.

Overall, the Cosmos SDK is a powerful and flexible tool for blockchain developers,
offering a wide range of features and the ability to create customized, interoperable
solutions. Its modular architecture and flexible programming options make it a popular
choice for creating new blockchain applications.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a virtual machine that is used to run smart contracts
on an EVM compatible blockchain. It is responsible for executing the code that is written in 
Solidity or other programming languages that can be compiled into EVM bytecode.

The EVM is a deterministic virtual machine, meaning that given the same input,
it will always produce the same output. This is important for ensuring
that smart contracts can be executed consistently across all nodes in the network.

The EVM has its own set of opcodes that are used to perform operations such as
arithmetic, logic, and storage. These opcodes are used to execute the bytecode
that is generated from a smart contract. The EVM also has its own memory and storage,
which is separate from the memory and storage of the nodes that are running the EVM.

Smart contracts are executed on the EVM in a sandboxed environment, which
means that they have limited access to external resources and cannot
interact directly with the outside world. Instead, they must interact
with the Ethereum network through a set of predefined interfaces.

The EVM is a crucial component of the Ethereum blockchain, as it allows
developers to create decentralized applications that can execute autonomously
on the network. Its sandboxed environment and deterministic execution ensure
that smart contracts can be trusted to behave as intended, without the need
for third-party intermediaries.

## CometBFT
Comet BFT is a consensus algorithm designed for use in blockchain networks.
It is based on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) model,
which is a consensus mechanism that allows a network to reach
agreement on the state of the ledger even in the presence of malicious nodes.

## Precompiles
An EVM precompile contract is a special type of smart contract that is
included in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by default. Precompile contracts
are typically written in low-level programming languages, such as C or Assembly,
and are used to perform complex calculations or operations that are not easily
performed using the EVM's built-in opcodes.

## IBC
Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) is a protocol that is built
into the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem. It allows for the transfer
of digital assets and data between different blockchains within
the Cosmos network.

The IBC protocol enables blockchains to communicate with each other
in a secure, decentralized, and trustless manner, without the need
for centralized exchanges or third-party intermediaries. This means
that tokens and other assets can be transferred between different 
blockchains within the Cosmos network seamlessly, providing greater 
liquidity and interoperability.

## Decentralized Governance
Decentralized governance is a system of decision-making in which 
authority and control are distributed among a network of participants, 
rather than being concentrated in a single entity or group of entities. 
In the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency, decentralized governance 
typically refers to the process of managing and improving a blockchain 
network in a decentralized manner, using a system of community-driven decision-making.

Governance in Cosmos refers to the decentralized decision-making process used 
to manage and improve the Cosmos network. It is based on the principle of stakeholder 
participation, which means that anyone who holds tokens on the network 
has a say in the network's governance.
