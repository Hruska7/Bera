# Generating, Signing, and Broadcasting Transactions
<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Stargazer CLI will work the same way as Cosmos SDK. Replace `simd` with `stargazerd`
</Callout>

Stargazer does not extend the base implementation of transaction handling in the Cosmos SDK.
For information on handling transactions in Stargazer you can reference [Generating, Signing and Broadcasting Transactions
](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/run-node/txs) 
from the Cosmos SDK documentation.
