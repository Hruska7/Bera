# Using Keplr With Polaris

In this section, we will guide you through the process of 
downloading Keplr and connecting it to a local Polaris node. 
Before proceeding, please ensure that you have a local node up and running. 
If you need help with this, you can refer to the [Local Machine](./running-a-node/running-locally) section for instructions.

To begin, you will need to download and install the Keplr browser extension. 
Once installed, you can then connect your Injected Keplr to your local Polaris 
node by following the steps provided in this section.

You can download and install the Keplr browser extension [here](https://www.keplr.app/download).

## Adding Polaris Local Network

Adding a custom network to Keplr cannot be done through its user interface and must be performed programmatically. 
However, you can view relevant chain configuration information in the [Chain Configuration](./for-frontend-devs/chain-config) section. 
This information will be necessary to properly configure your custom network in Keplr.

To add the local Polaris network to your Keplr wallet, you can click the button below.
