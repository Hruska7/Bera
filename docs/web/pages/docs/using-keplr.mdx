## Adding Stargazer Local Network

Adding a custom network to Keplr cannot be done through its user interface and must be performed programmatically. 
However, you can view the necessary information about the chain in order to add it through this [link](./for-dapp-devs/chain-config). 
This information will be necessary to properly configure your custom network in Keplr.
