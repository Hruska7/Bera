# Precompile Performance

The use of precompiled contracts can significantly improve the 
performance and efficiency of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
This is particularly true for precompiled contracts written in Golang, 
which are typically much faster than smart contracts written in Solidity.

One reason for this is that Golang is a compiled language, meaning that 
the code is translated into machine-readable instructions before it is 
executed. This can result in faster execution times compared to Solidity, 
which is an interpreted language that is compiled at runtime.

In addition, Golang is a highly efficient and performant language, 
designed to provide fast and reliable performance for a wide range 
of applications. This can translate into significant performance 
gains when using precompiled contracts written in Golang.

Overall, precompiled contracts written in Golang can provide significant 
performance benefits for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
By leveraging the power and efficiency of Golang, developers can create 
high-performance contracts that execute faster and more efficiently 
than their Solidity counterparts. This can help to unlock new possibilities 
for decentralized applications and make blockchain technology more accessible 
and efficient for users around the world.
