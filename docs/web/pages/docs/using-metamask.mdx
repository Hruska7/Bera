# Using Metamask With Polaris

In this section, we will guide you through the process of 
downloading Metamask and connecting it to a local Polaris node. 
Before proceeding, please ensure that you have a local node up and running. 
If you need help with this, you can refer to the [Local Machine](./running-a-node/running-locally) section for instructions.

To begin, you will need to download and install the Metamask browser extension. 
Once installed, you can then connect your Injected Metamask to your local Polaris 
node by following the steps provided in this section.
