# .hive file extension

The `.hive` file extension used in the rpc simulation is the local replacement file for it's respective copy in the standard ethereum simulation folder.

The copy is used to make minor changes to the expected values of certain test cases to be compliant with the way that Polaris handles returns (ex. estimateGas).

Internally, this file replaces the destination in the Hive clone generated during `mage hive:setup`.

The motivation to keeping the file in plain text is to eliminate errors generated by dependencies of the file and to remove the need to create an additional go package within Polaris.
